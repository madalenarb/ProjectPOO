/**
 * This package contains classes that handle the representation of the graph,
 * management of the pheromones on the edges, and the graph operations needed for the ant colony algorithm.
 * <p>
 * Included are:
 * <li>{@link graph.GraphGenerator} - a utility class for creating and manipulating the graph that represents the ant colony's environment.</li>
 * <li>{@link graph.GraphFacade} - a singleton facade class that provides a simplified interface to interact with the graph and pheromone map.</li>
 * <p>
 * This package is part of the main module of the ant colony optimization algorithm.
