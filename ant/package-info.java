/**
 * Contains classes related to ants in the ant colony optimization algorithm.
 * The package includes the following classes:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ant.AntColony}: Represents an Ant Colony used in the ant colony optimization algorithm.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * These classes work together to simulate the behavior of ants in the ant colony optimization algorithm.
 * The ants make decisions about which nodes to visit, lay pheromones, and manage their current cycles.
 * The AntColony manages the ants, cycles, and the process of laying pheromones.
