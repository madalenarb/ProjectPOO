/**
 * Contains classes related to cycles in the ant colony optimization algorithm.
 * Cycles are represented as linked lists of nodes and play a crucial role in the
 * optimization process.
 * 
 * <p>The package includes the following classes:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link cycle.Cycle}: Represents a cycle in the graph with its associated weight.
 *     Provides methods for managing and manipulating the cycle.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>These classes provide the necessary functionality to create, modify, and analyze cycles within the ant colony optimization
 * algorithm. They are used to track the paths traversed by the ants and facilitate pheromone updates and evaporation.</p>
